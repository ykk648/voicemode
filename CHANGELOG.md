# Changelog

All notable changes to VoiceMode (formerly voice-mcp) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [8.9.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **A minimal voice-only example agent (VM-1658)** — The voicemode plugin now ships a `voice-only` subagent whose *only* tool is `converse` — no file access, shell, or editing, by design. It's the smallest thing that can hold a spoken conversation, so it starts with a tiny context footprint, and works whether voicemode is provided by the plugin or by a project `.mcp.json` (both `converse` tool names are whitelisted). Launch it for a quick voice-only chat, or copy it as a template for your own lean voice agents.

## [8.8.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

#### Conch — coordinate the voice channel across multiple agents (epic VM-1610)

The conch is VoiceMode's single-speaker lock. This release turns it into a full multi-agent coordination layer — hold the floor, queue for it, hand it off, and watch it from the CLI or MCP.

- **Hold the floor across turns** — `hold_conch=true` on `converse` keeps the channel between turns so a second agent can't cut in mid-thought; `pause_conversation` holds it across a deliberate pause. Opt-in, and released on your next turn, on process exit, or after a short idle timeout. (VM-1433)
- **Ordered waiter queue** — when the conch is busy, `converse` joins a fair FIFO queue instead of racing for it: choose `wait` (block until it's yours) or `callback` (return now, get pinged when granted). (VM-1619)
- **Notify-on-give** — an agent handed the floor while it's idle gets a "your turn" nudge in its pane instead of missing its turn. (VM-1625)
- **`voicemode conch` CLI** — `status`, `give`, `bump`, `release`, and `wait` to observe and drive the queue from the command line. (VM-1616)
- **MCP parity for remote agents** — a new `conch` MCP tool gives streamable-HTTP agents the same queue control as the CLI, over the same shared state. (VM-1622)
- **`conch give` can summon any running session** — hand the floor to an agent that isn't in line yet, not just one already waiting. (VM-1637)
- **Idle holds expire fast** — a held conch now lapses on a short, refreshed timeout (default 10s) so a quiet agent can't wedge the channel for everyone. (VM-1649)
- **Fair promotion** — the queue skips idle callback-waiters to promote the next agent actually blocking on the floor, so nobody starves behind an idle one. (VM-1625)

#### Other

- **Cartesia as a first-class cloud TTS provider with sub-second streaming ([#368](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/368))** — Adds Cartesia alongside OpenAI and Kokoro, with low-latency SSE PCM streaming (audio starts playing within a few hundred milliseconds) and a buffered WAV fallback, plus automatic primary→fallback model retry. It's auto-detected: add an `api.cartesia.ai` entry to `VOICEMODE_TTS_BASE_URLS` and set `CARTESIA_API_KEY` (with optional `VOICEMODE_CARTESIA_VOICE_ID` / `VOICEMODE_CARTESIA_MODEL` / `VOICEMODE_CARTESIA_FALLBACK_MODEL`). When Cartesia isn't configured the TTS path is unchanged. Contributed by [@Sallvainian](https://github.com/Sallvainian).
- **NixOS: build whisper.cpp (with CUDA) via a Nix flake, and clearer NixOS install guidance ([#319](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/319))** — Nix flake outputs build whisper.cpp from source (CPU + CUDA) with a `voice-mode-cuda` wrapper, and the whisper/kokoro install tools now detect NixOS and give actionable setup guidance instead of a cryptic FHS build failure. Contributed by [@KaiStarkk](https://github.com/KaiStarkk).
- **`converse --voice` now accepts relative and `~` paths to a reference clip (VM-1607)** — `--voice ./clip.wav`, `../clip.wav`, and `~/clip.wav` now work, not just absolute paths, and pick up a sidecar `<basename>.txt` transcript the same way.
- **Voice personas are now discoverable by agents (VM-1580)** — The `converse` tool and the `converse` / `voicemode` skills now point agents at a voice's persona file (`~/.voicemode/voices/<name>/README.md`), so an agent picking a voice can read *who it is and how it should behave*, not just its name.

### Fixed

- **Clearer guidance when the CUDA toolkit is missing during a GPU whisper install ([#250](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/250), fixes #249)** — A GPU-enabled whisper.cpp install on Linux without `nvcc` now detects the distro (apt vs dnf) and suggests the correct package-install command plus a `--no-gpu` CPU-only alternative, instead of a confusing build error. Contributed by [@htrex](https://github.com/htrex).
- **Pin the mlx-audio install spec to `>=0.4.3,<0.4.4` to block the broken 0.4.4 release (VM-1550, VM-1547)** — mlx-audio 0.4.4 regressed the Kokoro TTS decoder: `istftnet.py` SineGen crashes with a `[broadcast_shapes]` `ValueError` on longer utterances and returns HTTP 500. With mlx-audio as the primary TTS endpoint, voicemode's failover then masks this as a spurious "OpenAI API key is not set" error, producing intermittent, confusing converse failures. `voicemode service install mlx-audio` now caps below 0.4.4 (resolving to the crash-free 0.4.3) until a fixed upstream release ships. Existing installs on 0.4.4 should reinstall: `uv tool uninstall mlx-audio` then `voicemode service install mlx-audio` (or `uv tool install "mlx-audio==0.4.3" --force` with the server extras).
- **Freshly cloned voices no longer fail to synthesize with empty reference text (VM-1439)** — `clone add` saved the reference transcript where the loader didn't look, so a just-cloned voice synthesized with no reference text and failed. The loader now also reads it from `voice.md`, repairing existing cloned voices automatically.
- **`config set` no longer reports "updated" when nothing changed (VM-1628)** — Setting a key to the value it already had still rewrote `voicemode.env` and said `✅ updated successfully`. It now detects the no-op and reports `✓ already set to this value — no change`. Fixes the CLI, the MCP tool, and the installer.
- **The default `voicemode.env` no longer silently falls back to OpenAI (VM-1556)** — The generated default left the voice list commented out, so a hidden default (`af_sky,alloy`) put the OpenAI voice `alloy` in play — failing for users with local voices but no OpenAI key. It now ships local-only (`VOICEMODE_VOICES=af_sky`), with an opt-in line for adding OpenAI voices.

### Security

- **Pin `urllib3` and `jaraco-context` to safe versions, clearing 5 runtime High CVEs (VM-1640)** — Dependency constraints now force patched `urllib3` and `jaraco-context` (plus an `openai>=2` floor), clearing four urllib3 and one jaraco-context high-severity advisories. osv-scanner now reports 0 Critical.

## [8.7.1] - 2026-06-09

## [8.7.0] - 2026-06-09

### Security

- **Fixed X-Forwarded-For IP allowlist bypass in `voicemode serve` ([GHSA-2qvv-vjq9-g5r4](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/security/advisories/GHSA-2qvv-vjq9-g5r4), VM-1466)** — `IPAllowlistMiddleware` previously trusted the client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` header unconditionally, so a remote unauthenticated attacker could send `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` (or any allowed IP) to bypass the IP allowlist entirely and reach all HTTP MCP endpoints, including microphone recording and transcription (CVSS 8.6, High). The allowlist now decides on the **direct TCP peer**, and `X-Forwarded-For` is only honored when the peer is a configured trusted proxy. Affected `voice-mode <= 8.6.2`.

  **Migration (only if you run `voicemode serve` behind a reverse proxy):** if you rely on forwarded client IPs — e.g. Tailscale Funnel or another reverse proxy in front of `voicemode serve` — you must now declare the proxy's address so its `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted, via `--trust-proxy <CIDR>` (repeatable) or `VOICEMODE_SERVE_TRUSTED_PROXIES=<comma-separated CIDRs>`. When trusted, the forwarded chain is parsed right-to-left (skipping trusted hops) instead of blindly taking the leftmost, spoofable entry. Direct (non-proxied) deployments need no changes.

### Added

- **`install.sh` now detects system capability and offers mlx-audio on Apple Silicon (VM-1330)** — The `curl | bash` installer (`https://getvoicemode.com/install.sh`) assesses the host (Apple Silicon → excellent, other → good/limited) and, on Apple Silicon, offers to install and configure **mlx-audio** as the local voice engine — *even when whisper.cpp + Kokoro are already present*. The flow is **status-first**: it reports what's already installed and skips the prompt entirely when voice services are already satisfied. mlx-audio stays **opt-in** (whisper.cpp + Kokoro remain the cross-platform fallback; Intel Macs / Linux / Windows are unaffected). Reworded prompts and a de-emojified banner round out the pass. The large orange VoiceMode ASCII banner is restored (24-bit truecolor) after a regression to a compact 3-line version (VM-1324). Part of the installer overhaul for the mlx-audio release (epic VM-1322).

- **The voicemode plugin can connect to a streamable-HTTP server instead of the default local stdio (VM-1292, VM-1314)** — Set `VOICEMODE_MCP_URL` to point the plugin's bundled MCP at a remote (or same-machine) `voicemode serve`. The plugin ships **one** `.mcp.json` entry (`type: stdio`) whose command is a first-party smart launcher (`voicemode-mcp-launcher`): with `VOICEMODE_MCP_URL` unset it runs the local stdio server, byte-for-byte the previous behaviour; set, it acts as a **native** stdio↔Streamable-HTTP bridge (built on the bundled `fastmcp` — no `npx`/Node, no launch-time fetch). One server, one `mcp__voicemode__*` namespace either way — **remote mode no longer also spawns the local stdio server, and there is no manual `disabledMcpjsonServers` step**. Enables a plugin-only install (skills + commands + hooks, no local `voicemode`/Whisper/Kokoro) pointed at an audio host. Auth via secret-in-path (`/mcp/<secret>`) with optional `VOICEMODE_MCP_TOKEN` Bearer header — reuses the existing serve auth, no serve-side changes. `VOICEMODE_MCP_URL`/`_TOKEN` now also take effect from `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env` (the launcher reads it; an exported env var still wins). See the [Claude Code Plugin guide](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/blob/master/docs/guides/claude-code-plugin.md#transport-modes-local-stdio-vs-remote-http).

- **`voicemode converse --skip-stt`** -- Replaces `--no-wait` with a name that parallels the existing `--skip-tts` flag. Same behaviour: speak the message and exit without listening for a spoken response. The legacy `--no-wait` continues to work for now (see Deprecated).

- **`voice://voices` and `voice://voices/{provider}` MCP resources for structured TTS voice discovery (VM-1208)** — Streamable HTTP MCP clients (iOS app, web client, other agents) can now enumerate available TTS voices as JSON instead of scraping prose from the `voice_registry` tool. Both resources advertise `mime_type=application/json`, share an enumerator with the `voice_registry` tool (so the JSON resource and the LLM-facing prose can never disagree), and include impressions only for local callers (toggleable via `VOICEMODE_EXPOSE_LOCAL_VOICES_REMOTE`). 60-second in-process TTL on `/audio/voices` probes; OpenAI voices come from a hand-maintained constant. As a side-effect the `voice_registry` tool now reports `Voices: none detected` for offline endpoints instead of the legacy 67-voice phantom fallback. See [`voice://voices` reference](docs/reference/voices-resource.md).

#### Impressions (preview / experimental) (VM-1174)

VoiceMode can now do **impressions** -- speak in any voice from a short reference clip via local Qwen3-TTS on top of mlx-audio. Drop a 5-9 second WAV at `~/.voicemode/voices/<name>/default.wav`, then call `voicemode:converse(..., voice="<name>")` or `voicemode converse --voice <name>`. The model imitates the timbre and cadence of the clip; same technical path the unreleased "voice cloning" framing pointed at, with active "do an impression" framing instead.

**Apple Silicon only, opt-in, not enabled by default.** Nothing happens until you run `voicemode service install mlx-audio` and add at least one voice directory. Intel Macs / Linux / Windows are unaffected -- Kokoro and OpenAI TTS continue to work as normal.

- New env vars (replacing the unreleased `VOICEMODE_CLONE_*` candidates -- see Migration below):
  - `VOICEMODE_VOICES_DIR` (default `~/.voicemode/voices`) -- directory of voice profiles, one subdirectory per voice.
  - `VOICEMODE_REMOTE_VOICES_DIR` -- path translation for remote mlx-audio servers (e.g. ms2).
  - `VOICEMODE_MLX_AUDIO_BASE_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8890/v1`) -- OpenAI-compatible mlx-audio endpoint.
  - `VOICEMODE_IMPRESSIONS_MODEL` (default `mlx-community/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-bf16`) -- Hugging Face model ID; pick `-4bit` / `-5bit` / `-6bit` quants to trade quality for speed/RAM.
- Code dir: `voice_mode/tools/clone/` renamed to `voice_mode/tools/impressions/` (mechanical `git mv`; function names `clone_add` / `clone_list` / `clone_remove` preserved as internal symbols).
- Template generator (`voice_mode/resources/configuration.py`) gains three sections: STT Models, MLX Audio Service, Impressions, per the env-grouping proposal in VM-1172.
- Docs: new [Impressions guide](docs/guides/impressions.md) (replaces `docs/guides/voice-cloning.md`), with footguns covering Kokoro voice-name collisions, Apple Silicon constraint, and first-synthesis model download.
- Skill: new `.claude/skills/impressions/` skill with progressive-disclosure deep-dives for setup (model quants, remote mlx-audio, troubleshooting) and finding samples (clip ranking heuristic, ffmpeg loudnorm recipes, voice-lab integration).

#### Transcript Visibility (echo user/assistant around converse) (VM-1166, [#371](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/371))

Newer Claude Code releases collapse MCP tool calls in the visible transcript, which hid the spoken side of `voicemode:converse` exchanges. VoiceMode now keeps the conversation reconstructible from the transcript alone.

- **Echo both sides as Markdown blockquotes** -- `> **ASSISTANT (voicemode):** ...` before each converse call, `> **USER (voicemode):** ...` after.
- **Companion-mode assistant echo, verbatim user echo** -- Assistant echo reformats prose into Markdown (lists, code, etc.) without paraphrasing; user echo is verbatim, no truncation by default.
- **Asymmetric gating** -- Assistant echo always plays (including speak-only narration); user echo only when a captured utterance exists.
- **Mid-session opt-out** -- Strict-stop semantics: when the user asks to stop echoing, the opt-out turn itself is not echoed back.
- **Progressive disclosure** -- Heavy detail lives in `docs/transcript-visibility.md` so the always-loaded skill stays thin (~1,070 tokens saved per fresh load).

#### Other

- **Whisper start uses wrapper script** ([#283](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/283) by @codesmax) -- Whisper service start now goes through a wrapper script that handles fallback paths cleanly.

- **`voicemode autofocus on|off|status` — toggle tmux auto-focus mid-session (VM-1024)** — A new CLI command (modelled on `voicemode soundfonts`) to flip the "focus the agent's tmux pane when it speaks" behaviour on or off without editing `voicemode.env` or restarting agents. `off` drops a sentinel at `~/.voicemode/autofocus-disabled` that wins over transient visual-conch holds; `--config` persists the matching env var. Ships the `off` mode (today's behaviour is the implicit `gentle`; an `aggressive` mode is deferred).

### Migration

- **`VOICEMODE_CLONE_BASE_URL` and `VOICEMODE_CLONE_MODEL` are renamed.** Replace them in your `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env`:
  - `VOICEMODE_CLONE_BASE_URL` -> `VOICEMODE_MLX_AUDIO_BASE_URL`
  - `VOICEMODE_CLONE_MODEL` -> `VOICEMODE_IMPRESSIONS_MODEL`
  - `VOICEMODE_CLONE_PORT` -> use `VOICEMODE_MLX_AUDIO_PORT` (the old name was a duplicate; same default `8890`).

  The old names are honoured for one release with a one-shot per-process deprecation warning routed through `voice_mode/_env_deprecation.py`. **Removal scheduled for 8.8.0.**
- **The `sayas` CLI is removed.** Use `voicemode converse --voice <name>` instead -- it routes cloned voices through the same mlx-audio backend `sayas` did, with the rest of the converse pipeline (silence detection, audio formats, providers) for free. `sayas` was an alternate door to the same room; the unified converse surface is the canonical path now.

### Fixed

- **Long utterances ending in a trigger word are no longer discarded** (VM-291) -- The local repeat/wait detection (`should_repeat` / `should_wait`) fired whenever a transcript merely *ended* with a trigger phrase (`what`, `repeat`, `pardon`, `wait`, ...), so a 30-word sentence ending in "what" was thrown away and replaced with a "Repeating" replay -- losing the whole utterance. Detection now only fires when at most a few words precede the trigger, configurable **per trigger class**: `VOICEMODE_REPEAT_MAX_LEADING_WORDS` and `VOICEMODE_WAIT_MAX_LEADING_WORDS` (both default `4`). A bare "what?" still replays, but substantive messages are delivered to the LLM intact. Also fixes a substring bug where "somewhat" matched the trigger "what" -- matching is now word-boundary aware.
- **Service install error messages now reference real CLI commands** (VM-1409) -- Errors like "Whisper start script not found. Please run whisper_install first." pointed at MCP tool names (`whisper_install`, `kokoro_install`, `download_model`) that don't exist as CLI commands, so users hitting the error from the CLI had no way to act on it. Updated to match the existing mlx-audio branch's style -- now reference `voicemode service install whisper`, `voicemode service install kokoro`, and `voicemode whisper model <name>`.
- **mlx-audio install no longer fails at the patch step** (VM-1126) -- `voicemode service install mlx-audio` would fail with "Patch step failed: ... 2 out of 5 hunks failed" against mlx-audio 0.4.3. The MLX Metal serialisation lock the bundled patch carried ([ml-explore/mlx#2133](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx/issues/2133)) is upstream from 0.4.3 on, so the patch now adds lines that already exist and rejects.
- **mlx-audio STT `response_format` patch restored** (VM-1128) -- VM-1126 over-removed: while the Metal lock was upstreamed, the OpenAI-style STT `response_format` handling on `/v1/audio/transcriptions` is *not* yet in mlx-audio 0.4.3. Restored as a separate patch.

### Changed

- **Voice names must be lowercase in the skill** -- Skill guidance updated to require lowercase voice names (e.g. `af_sky`, not `AF_Sky`) to match the provider voice catalog.
- **Parallel tool calls section simplified** -- Trimmed the "speak + act in parallel" section in the voicemode skill while preserving the key teaching content.
- **mlx-audio pin floored at `>=0.4.3`** (VM-1126) -- `MLX_AUDIO_PIP_PACKAGE` now embeds the version specifier, so `uv tool install` refuses earlier releases that needed the deleted patch.
- **`install.sh` now picks STT and TTS engines separately (VM-1421)** -- The `curl | bash` installer's Apple Silicon prompt is now a **TTS-engine** choice — `[1]` Whisper + mlx-audio (recommended), `[2]` Whisper + Kokoro, `[3]` skip — and **STT is always whisper.cpp** (mlx-whisper still ships the VM-94 seed/repetition bug in 0.4.3). STT and TTS endpoint preferences are written separately, and if mlx-audio install fails the installer falls back to Kokoro and re-points TTS rather than leaving you with no voice. Off-Apple-Silicon prompts gain `(STT)`/`(TTS)` labels. The `VM-1318` gate is preserved: non-interactive installs without `--voice` still skip local voice services.
- **Transcript-visibility echo guidance now lives in the `converse` tool description (VM-1499)** -- The echo convention (printing `> **ASSISTANT (voicemode):** …` / `> **USER (voicemode):** …` blockquotes around each voice exchange, from VM-1166) was previously only in the voicemode skill, so it silently didn't happen when the skill wasn't loaded. A short instruction now ships in the `converse` tool's own description, so the echo is prompted regardless of skill state. (Robust hook-based enforcement is tracked as follow-up.)

### Deprecated

- **`voicemode converse --no-wait`** -- Renamed to `--skip-stt` to make the intent ("speak only; skip listening for a spoken response") obvious and parallel with `--skip-tts`. `--no-wait` still works for now: it continues to function, is still completed by shell completion, but its help text is marked `[DEPRECATED]` and using it prints a deprecation notice to stderr. It will be removed in a future release. Migrate to `voicemode converse --skip-stt`.

### Removed

- **Bundled `voice_mode/data/patches/mlx_audio_server.patch`** (VM-1126) -- The Metal-lock half of the patch was upstreamed in mlx-audio 0.4.3. The patch-apply step in `voice_mode/tools/mlx_audio/install.py` (and its `_apply_server_patch` / `_find_installed_server_py` / `_query_installed_version` helpers) is gone, along with the `voice_mode/data/**/*.patch` packaging glob and the corresponding tests. (The STT `response_format` patch is restored separately under VM-1128.)
- **`sayas` CLI** (VM-1174) -- the standalone `sayas <voice> "text"` command is gone, along with its bash completion (`voice_mode/data/completions/sayas.bash`), test module (`tests/test_sayas_cli.py`), and `[project.scripts]` entry. Migration: `voicemode converse --voice <name> -m "text" --skip-stt` (or pass `voice="<name>"` to the `voicemode:converse` MCP tool).

## [8.6.2] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **Kokoro service no longer silently dies after `UVICORN_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` requests on Linux** (VM-1398, [#448](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/issues/448) — reported by @JulesGosnell) — The systemd unit `voicemode-kokoro.service` combined `Restart=on-failure` with `Environment="UVICORN_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=25"` (the memory-leak workaround from VM-358). Hitting the request limit makes uvicorn exit cleanly (status 0), which `on-failure` treats as a successful shutdown — so the service stayed dead and the 26th TTS request failed with connection refused. The leak workaround was silently disabling the very service it was meant to protect. **Switched to `Restart=always`** in the kokoro template (and defensively in the whisper and serve templates for the same shape of bug). `RestartPreventExitStatus=127` still guards against fight-looping on a missing executable. **macOS / launchd was unaffected** — its plist uses `KeepAlive=true`, which restarts on clean exits too. To recover an existing v1.3.0 deployment without reinstalling: `sed -i 's/^Restart=on-failure/Restart=always/' ~/.config/systemd/user/voicemode-kokoro.service && systemctl --user daemon-reload && systemctl --user restart voicemode-kokoro.service`.

- **Fresh plugin installs no longer fail with "voicemode-mcp-launcher not found"** (VM-1364, [#441](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/issues/441)) — `.mcp.json` on `master` was switched to invoke the new `voicemode-mcp-launcher` binary (VM-1314), but the binary only exists in `master` — it isn't shipped in the latest PyPI release (8.6.1). Because Claude Code plugins install `.mcp.json` from the default branch, every fresh `claude plugin install voicemode@voicemode` produced `voicemode: voicemode-mcp-launcher - ✗ Failed to connect`. Reverted `.mcp.json` to the v8.6.1 form (`command: uv`, `args: [run, voicemode]`) so plugin installs work against the released package. The launcher invocation will be restored at the next release, alongside the published binary.
- **Provider tests no longer fail when user voicemode.env overrides TTS/STT base URLs** (VM-1138, [#370](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/370)) -- `tests/test_providers.py` (and friends) now isolate themselves from the user's `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env`, so `VOICEMODE_TTS_BASE_URLS` / `VOICEMODE_STT_BASE_URLS` overrides on the dev machine no longer break the suite.
- **Opus playback no longer truncates the tail** -- Pad trailing silence on opus output to prevent the last frame being clipped.
- **Kokoro install pinned to fork with opus tail fix** -- `voicemode service install kokoro` now installs from `ai-cora/Kokoro-FastAPI` until the fix lands upstream.

## [8.6.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- **Tmux auto-focus no longer steals pane focus** -- When `VOICEMODE_AUTO_FOCUS_PANE` is enabled, converse now only raises the agent's tmux window without changing which pane has focus. Previously, `select-pane` was called alongside `select-window`, which would yank the cursor away from whatever pane the user was working in — especially disruptive in multi-pane layouts.

## [8.6.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Auto-focus tmux pane on converse** (VM-922) -- Set `VOICEMODE_AUTO_FOCUS_PANE=true` to automatically focus the agent's tmux pane when converse acquires the conch. Supports multi-session setups via `switch-client`, and respects a `focus-hold` sentinel so other tools (e.g. show-me) can temporarily suppress focus changes. New `VOICEMODE_FOCUS_HOLD_SECONDS` setting. See the Multi-Agent Voice section in the configuration guide.
- **Restored `voicemode connect auth` CLI commands** (VM-992) -- `voicemode connect auth login`, `logout`, and `status` are back after the VM-958 legacy cleanup. `login` opens an Auth0 browser flow (or prints the URL with `--no-browser`); `status` shows account, token expiry, and refresh state.

### Fixed

- **ESC during converse no longer kills the MCP server** (VM-1026, [#337](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/issues/337), [#339](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/339)) -- Pressing ESC while a `converse` call was in flight used to take the entire voicemode MCP server offline, requiring `/mcp` reconnect. The tool now catches `CancelledError`, cleans up audio state, and returns control to Claude without bringing the server down.
- **Circular import in changelog/release_notes under pytest 9** -- Deferred `voice_mode.resources.changelog` import inside `release_notes_prompt` so `tests/test_changelog_resource.py` collects cleanly under pytest 9's stricter import rules. No behavioural change; the resource is still registered at import time.
- **Star notification failures on multiline bios** -- GitHub user bios containing newlines no longer break the star notification script.

### Changed

- **Channel server extracted to its own plugin** -- The bundled `channel/` TypeScript server has been removed from this repo and now lives at [mbailey/voicemode-channel](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode-channel). Install with `claude plugin install voicemode-channel@mbailey` to receive inbound voice calls from phone or web app clients.

### Removed

- **Legacy VoiceMode Connect Python integration** (VM-958) -- Removed the Python-based WebSocket client, agent registry, inbox symlinks, and filesystem message delivery that pre-dated the Claude Code channel system. Superseded by the `voicemode-channel` plugin.
  - Deleted: `voice_mode/connect/`, `voice_mode/connect_registry.py`, `voice_mode/tools/connect_status.py`, 10 Connect hook scripts + JSON configs, 11 Connect test files, `docs/connect/`, Connect service templates.
  - Cleaned: `config.py` (`CONNECT_ENABLED`, `CONNECT_WS_URL`, `CONNECT_USERS`, etc.), `cli.py` (`voicemode connect` command group — `connect auth` subcommands restored separately by VM-992), `server.py` (Connect WebSocket lifespan handler), `service.py` (`connect` service entry).
- **Stale Connect hook references from `plugin.json`** (VM-958) -- Cleaned up dangling hook entries left behind by the legacy Connect removal.

## [8.5.1] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Show-me plugin in marketplace** - Added show-me as an external plugin (source: mbailey/show-me) to the VoiceMode plugin marketplace

### Fixed

- **Pass WHISPER_LANGUAGE config to STT API** ([#253](https://github.com/mbailey/voicemode/pull/253) by @htrex) - The `VOICEMODE_WHISPER_LANGUAGE` config existed but was never passed to the transcription API. Local whisper.cpp defaults to English when no language parameter is given, producing incorrect transcriptions for non-English audio. Now passes `language="auto"` explicitly to whisper.cpp and handles the OpenAI API difference (omit parameter for auto-detect)

### Changed

- **Parallel tool calls guidance** - VoiceMode skill now documents the "speak + act in parallel" pattern for zero dead air during voice conversations, with examples of when to use parallel vs sequential tool calls

## [8.5.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

#### PermissionRequest Notification Sound (VM-892)

- **PermissionRequest hook event** - Plays an audio notification when Claude Code needs user approval for a tool, so you don't miss permission prompts while away from the screen
- **Bypasses conch lock** - PermissionRequest sounds play even during active voice conversations, ensuring you always hear when approval is needed

#### Mute Converse Sounds (VM-898)

- **Auto-mute voicemode converse tool sounds** - PreToolUse/PostToolUse sounds are automatically suppressed for the voicemode converse tool (both local and Connect variants), since voice conversations provide their own audio feedback. Other tool use sounds still play during voice conversations, making them more meaningful — they indicate something is happening that you wouldn't otherwise hear

## [8.4.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

#### Soundfont Toggle (VM-312)

- **`voicemode soundfonts on/off/status` CLI commands** - Session-scoped soundfont toggle using a sentinel file for zero-overhead checking. Disable tool-use sounds without editing config files
- **`--config` flag for persistent toggle** - `soundfonts on/off --config` also updates `voicemode.env` so the setting persists across restarts
- **Environment variable awareness** - Status shows the effective state from both sentinel file and `VOICEMODE_SOUNDFONTS_ENABLED` env var, warning when they conflict
- **Hooks installation status** - `soundfonts status` now shows whether hooks are installed, replacing a static tip message

#### Connect Lifecycle Hooks (VM-816, VM-820)

- **SessionEnd cleanup hook** (VM-820) - Automatically removes inbox-live symlink and session identity file when a Claude Code session ends; subagent-safe (only team leads clean up)
- **Inbox-live symlink validation** (VM-816) - `connect_status` validates that inbox-live belongs to the current session's team before setting "available" presence, preventing cross-session message routing

#### Shell Completions (VM-832)

- **Context-aware hook completions** - `hooks add` only suggests hooks not yet installed; `hooks remove` only suggests installed hooks

#### Documentation (VM-242)

- **Soundfonts guide** - New `docs/guides/soundfonts.md` covering usage, directory structure, sound lookup order, customization, and troubleshooting
- **CLI reference updates** - Added soundfonts and claude hooks commands to `docs/reference/cli.md`
- **Environment reference updates** - Added `VOICEMODE_SOUNDFONTS_ENABLED` and `VOICEMODE_HOOK_DEBUG` to `docs/reference/environment.md`

### Changed

- **Connect status queries gateway** (VM-826) - `voicemode connect status` now opens a short-lived WebSocket to the gateway for real-time presence state instead of reading stale local files. Falls back to local state when gateway is unreachable
- **Agent-only presence model** (VM-822, VM-824) - Presence is now entirely agent-driven via the `connect_status` MCP tool. Removed standalone daemon model (`connect up/down`), filesystem user scanning, and fallback to scanning `~/.voicemode/connect/users/`
- **Idempotent soundfont config updates** - `soundfonts on/off --config` skips writes when the value is already correct
- **Config env sync** - `voicemode.env` updates now also sync `os.environ`, eliminating stale environment warnings

### Fixed

- **Hibernation-friendly keepalive** - Send literal `"ping"` text instead of JSON `{ type: "heartbeat" }` for WebSocket keepalive. The Durable Object's auto-response handles `"ping"→"pong"` during hibernation without waking the DO, eliminating ~2 storage reads per 25-second heartbeat cycle
- **Ghost contacts on dashboard** (VM-822) - Stopped the Connect client from announcing all users found in `~/.voicemode/connect/users/` on WebSocket connect. Each agent now only announces its own registered identity
- **Stale inbox-live symlink routing** (VM-816) - Concurrent sessions no longer risk routing messages to the wrong agent's team inbox

### Removed

- **`voicemode agent` CLI command group** (VM-828) - Legacy tmux-based agent management (~900 lines) that predated the plugin-based agent system. Noted as removed in 8.3.0 but code remained
- **`voicemode history` commands** (VM-830) - Broken load/search/play commands that overlapped with exchanges
- **`voicemode version` command** (VM-830) - Redundant with `--version` flag
- **`voicemode update` command** (VM-830) - Over-complex; users should use `uv`/`pip` directly
- **`voicemode diag dependencies`** (VM-830) - Redundant with `voicemode deps`
- **`voicemode connect up/down` commands** (VM-824) - Replaced by agent-driven presence via `connect_status` MCP tool

## [8.3.0] - 2026-02-24 - Happy 1st Birthday, Claude Code!

_February 24, 2026 — One year since Claude Code launched. This release celebrates with
VoiceMode Connect: make inbound voice calls to your Claude Code agents from anywhere._

### Added

#### VoiceMode Connect — Inbound Voice Calls

- **connect_status MCP tool** (VM-770) - Manage agent presence directly from Claude Code conversations; always-on visibility on the voicemode.dev dashboard
- **Auto-connect on startup** (VM-766) - WebSocket connection established automatically when the MCP server starts, so agents appear online without manual steps
- **Deterministic device ID and scoped capabilities** (VM-768) - Stable device identity across restarts with fine-grained capability declarations
- **User-based mailbox system** (VM-724) - Modular Connect architecture with per-user message routing, replacing the previous monolithic approach
- **OS keychain credential storage** (VM-720) - Credentials stored securely via the `keyring` library with automatic fallback for headless/SSH environments
- **Wakeable agent registration** (VMD-104) - Agents register as wakeable on the Connect gateway, enabling inbound calls to start conversations
- **Configurable wake command** (VM-712) - Set a custom command to run when your agent receives an inbound wake-up call
- **`connect up/down` commands** (VM-734) - Simple commands to announce availability and watch for incoming calls, replacing the old standby workflow
- **Idempotent connect_status with auto-registration** - Calling connect_status multiple times is safe and automatically registers the agent if needed
- **Username parameter for explicit identity** - Override auto-detected username when needed for multi-account setups
- **OAuth callback page styled with Ink & Seal theme** - Polished dark-themed authentication flow

#### Hook-based Connect Architecture (VM-802)

- **Mid-conversation message delivery** (Phase 1) - PostToolUse hook delivers incoming messages while the agent is actively working, not just between turns
- **Agent wake-up on pending messages** (Phase 2) - Stop hook checks for pending messages when the agent goes idle, triggering wake-up if calls are waiting
- **Session identity with fallback chain** (Phase 3) - SessionStart hook establishes agent identity using session files, environment variables, or user prompts
- **Wake-from-idle** (Phase 5) - TeamCreate hook and session store enable agents to wake from idle state when receiving inbound calls
- **Automatic away presence** - Agents downgrade to "away" status when wake-from-idle is not available, giving callers accurate availability info
- **Lazy WebSocket connections** - WebSocket only connects when needed, removing the Teams feature dependency
- **Connect hooks as VoiceMode plugin** - All Connect hooks ship as part of the VoiceMode plugin, no manual settings.json editing required

### Changed

- **Default VAD aggressiveness raised to 3** (GH-248) - Level 2 caused ~93% false positive speech detection on MacBook Pro mics, preventing silence detection from triggering. Level 3 eliminates false positives while maintaining good speech detection
- **Default Kokoro voice changed to af_river** - Replaced af_nicole with af_river in recommended voice lists for a more natural sound
- **Auth commands moved to `connect auth` subgroup** (VM-744) - `voicemode connect auth login/logout` for clearer command organization
- **Kokoro memory leak mitigation** (VM-358) - Default `KOKORO_MAX_REQUEST=25` and `UVICORN_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` in service templates to auto-restart workers before memory grows unbounded
- **Auth token moved to Authorization header** (VM-784) - WebSocket authentication uses standard Authorization header instead of URL parameter for improved security
- **Connect wire protocol aligned with gateway spec** (VMD-124) - Python client updated to match the VMD-124 gateway wire protocol for reliable cross-platform messaging
- **Credential store defaults to plaintext with singleton cache** - More reliable across platforms than keychain-first approach, with automatic fallback for headless environments
- **FastMCP pinned to <3** (VM-742) - Avoids breaking changes in FastMCP 3.0 until migration is complete
- **Project name separated from user identity** - Configuration now cleanly distinguishes between project context and user identity

### Fixed

- **Delivery confirmation sent to wrong user** (VM-762) - Delivery receipts were going to the message recipient instead of the sender
- **User lookup by display_name** - Match users by display_name when username lookup fails, fixing cases where names differ between systems
- **Simultaneous agent speech** - Conch now properly prevents multiple agents from speaking at the same time in multi-agent setups
- **Listen duration timing overrides** (VM-746) - Agents can no longer accidentally override silence detection timing defaults
- **Register race condition on startup** - Resolved a race condition where agents could fail to register as available during rapid startup sequences
- **Claude Code inbox format** - Fixed message format for live delivery to match Claude Code's expected inbox structure
- **WebSocket connection state in connect_status** - Properly await WebSocket connection before checking state, preventing false "disconnected" reports
- **Session ID discovery** - Falls back to session file scanning when CLAUDE_SESSION_ID is not available in the MCP environment
- **Username auto-discovery** - Automatically discovers username from session files instead of prompting users in hooks
- **Consistent auth login guidance** - All Connect error messages now include clear instructions for running `voicemode connect auth login`
- **Input sanitization and lifespan error handling** - Improved robustness of the MCP server startup and shutdown lifecycle
- **VOICEMODE_CONNECT_ENABLED guard** - Hook scripts now check the feature flag before executing, preventing unexpected Connect behavior when disabled

### Removed

- **Claude Code agent templates** - Removed built-in agent templates in favor of the plugin-based agent system
- **Standby command** (VM-734) - Replaced by the simpler `connect up/down` workflow
- **MCP connect tools module** (VM-724, VM-734) - Connect functionality moved to hook-based architecture; the old MCP tools module has been removed
- **Wakeable terminology** (VM-724) - Renamed to "available" throughout the codebase for clarity

## [8.2.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **STT Prompt for Vocabulary Biasing** - Set `VOICEMODE_STT_PROMPT` to hint Whisper on frequently misrecognized words (e.g., proper nouns, technical terms)

- **VoiceMode Marketplace** - `claude install voicemode@voicemode` plugin distribution via marketplace
- **VoiceMode Connect Skill** (VM-595) - Bundled skill and documentation for remote voice via mobile/web clients

### Fixed

- **Soundfonts silently disabled for all users** - Hook receiver returned false when `VOICEMODE_SOUNDFONTS_ENABLED` was commented out (the default) instead of falling through to enabled
- **Whisper CoreML hang on M1 Max** (VM-640) - Startup timeout (120s) with auto-fallback to Metal-only when CoreML compilation hangs on incompatible hardware
- **webrtcvad broken with setuptools>=81** - Switched to `webrtcvad-wheels` fork which uses `importlib.metadata` instead of removed `pkg_resources`
- **Hook receiver not installed** (VM-621) - `voicemode claude hooks add` now installs the bash hook receiver and symlinks it correctly
- **Connect auto-enabled by default** (VM-633) - Changed `CONNECT_AUTO_ENABLED` to default false so devices don't appear on dashboard without opt-in

### 🎉 Major Features

#### **Voice Control Commands - "Repeat" and "Wait"** (VM-199)

VoiceMode now understands natural voice commands during conversations:

- **"Repeat" Command**: Say phrases like "could you repeat that?" or "say that again" to replay the last message
- **"Wait" Command**: Say "wait a minute" or "hold on" to pause the conversation for 60 seconds
