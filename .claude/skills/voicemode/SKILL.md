## First-Time Setup

If VoiceMode isn't working or MCP fails to connect, run:

```
/voicemode:install
```

After install, reconnect MCP: `/mcp` → select voicemode → "Reconnect" (or restart Claude Code).

If Claude Code prompts you for permission on `voicemode:converse` or `voicemode:service`, see [references/permissions.md](references/permissions.md) for the one-time allow-list setup.

# VoiceMode

Natural voice conversations with Claude Code using speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS).

**Note:** The Python package is `voice-mode` (hyphen), but the CLI command is `voicemode` (no hyphen).

## When to Use MCP vs CLI

| Task                | Use                      | Why                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Voice conversations | MCP `voicemode:converse` | Faster - server already running |
| Service start/stop  | MCP `voicemode:service`  | Works within Claude Code        |
| Installation        | CLI `voice-mode-install` | One-time setup                  |
| Configuration       | CLI `voicemode config`   | Edit settings directly          |
| Diagnostics         | CLI `voicemode diag`     | Administrative tasks            |

## Usage

Use the `converse` MCP tool to speak to users and hear their responses:

```python
# Speak and listen for response (most common usage)
voicemode:converse("Hello! What would you like to work on?")

# Speak without waiting (for narration while working)
voicemode:converse("Searching the codebase now...", wait_for_response=False)
```

For most conversations, just pass your message - defaults handle everything else.
Use default converse tool parameters unless there's a good reason not to. Timing parameters (`listen_duration_max`, `listen_duration_min`) use smart defaults with silence detection - don't override unless the user requests it or you see a clear need. Defaults are configurable by the user via `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env`.

| Parameter           | Default  | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `message`           | required | Text to speak                                                        |
| `wait_for_response` | true     | Listen after speaking                                                |
| `voice`             | auto     | TTS voice -- **must be lowercase** (e.g. `af_river`, not `AF_River`) |

**Voice name rule:** If you specify a `voice`, it MUST be lowercase with
underscores. Kokoro rejects capitalized names like `AF_River` with a 400
error. Valid examples: `af_river`, `af_sky`, `bm_daniel`, `bf_emma`.
The prefix encodes language+gender: `af_` = American female, `am_` =
American male, `bf_` = British female, `bm_` = British male.

When in doubt, omit `voice` entirely -- auto-select picks a working
default.

**Voice discovery for apps and agents:** read the `voice://voices` MCP
resource for a structured JSON list of available voices (with
`voice://voices/{provider}` for per-backend filtering). The
`voice_registry` tool returns the same data as prose for the LLM
mid-conversation. Both share the underlying enumerator so they never
drift. See [voices resource reference](../../docs/reference/voices-resource.md).

**Persona discovery:** voice IDs from `voice://voices` map to character profiles on disk at `~/.voicemode/voices/<name>/README.md` (grouped voices: `<group>/<name>/README.md`; index at `~/.voicemode/voices/PERSONAS.md`). Read that README before speaking in character — who they are, how they speak, sample lines. Not every voice has one yet; fall back to the bare voice if absent.

For all parameters, see [Converse Parameters](../../docs/reference/converse-parameters.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Narrate without waiting** - Use `wait_for_response=False` when announcing actions
2. **One question at a time** - Don't bundle multiple questions in voice mode
3. **Check status first** - Verify services are running before starting conversations
4. **Let VoiceMode auto-select** - Don't hardcode providers unless user has preference
5. **First run is slow** - Model downloads happen on first start (2-5 min), then instant

## Voicemode echo (default ON)

Some hosts (e.g. newer Claude Code) collapse MCP tool calls — voice turns vanish from the visible transcript. **Unless requested otherwise, default to voicemode echo:** print each `voicemode:converse` exchange as Markdown blockquotes so it stays readable on screen.

```
> **ASSISTANT (voicemode):** <message arg passed to converse>
[voicemode:converse tool call]
> **USER (voicemode):** <captured user message>
```

- Speaker first in caps; `(voicemode)` is the channel tag.
- **Order matters.** Write the **ASSISTANT** blockquote *before* the `voicemode:converse` tool call, in the same response that issues it — so the user can read along while the audio plays (and recover the message if they miss part of it). Write the **USER** blockquote in your *next* response, after the tool result returns. Don't batch both echoes after the call.
- **ASSISTANT echo: always**, including `wait_for_response=false` (speak-only narration still produces visible content that would otherwise vanish).
- **USER echo: only when a user message was captured** (skip on `wait_for_response=false`, empty result, or transcription failure — there is nothing to echo).
- **Assistant echo: verbatim by default** — the exact string passed to `message`, not paraphrased or reformatted. Reasons: least-surprising for the reader + diagnostic value when comparing printed text to spoken audio.
- **User echo: verbatim and full** — exact words, no truncation; rewriting or shortening risks distorting intent.
- **Visual aids (lists, tables, code) belong AFTER the blockquote, not inside it.** The blockquote stays a clean verbatim copy of what was spoken; richer formatting can follow as separate prose.
- Don't double-echo: if a sentence already appears as visible prose in the same response, don't also blockquote it.
- **Disable on request** — canonical phrase: **"disable voicemode echo"**. Stop echoing for the rest of the session and honour the same phrase if it appears in the user's startup context (some hosts already render voice tool calls inline, where echoes would double up).

## Parallel Tool Calls (Zero Dead Air)

Eliminate dead air by sending voice and action calls in the **same response**:

```
# FAST: speak + act in parallel (all fire concurrently)
voicemode:converse("Checking that now.", wait_for_response=False)
Bash("git status")
Agent(prompt="Research X", run_in_background=True)

# SLOW: sequential — unnecessary delay between speech and action
voicemode:converse("Checking that now.", wait_for_response=False)
# ... waits for TTS to finish ...
Bash("git status")
```

Then report results in the next response:
```
voicemode:converse("Here's what I found: ...", wait_for_response=True)
```

| Scenario                 | Approach       | Why                                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Announce + do work       | **Parallel**   | No dependency between speech and action             |
| Announce + spawn agent   | **Parallel**   | Agent runs in background anyway                     |
| Check result then report | **Sequential** | Need result before speaking                         |
| Listen for response      | **Sequential** | `wait_for_response=True` blocks until user speaks   |

**Key insight:** Wall-clock time = longest call, not the sum. All tool types (MCP, Bash, Agent, Read) can be mixed in one response.

## Handling Pauses and Wait Requests

When the user asks you to wait or give them time:

**Short pauses (up to 60 seconds):** If the user says something ending with "wait" (e.g., "hang on", "give me a sec", "wait"), VoiceMode automatically pauses for 60 seconds then resumes listening. This is built-in.

**Longer pauses (2+ minutes):** Use `bash sleep N` where N is seconds. For example, if the user says "give me 5 minutes":

```bash
sleep 300  # Wait 5 minutes
```

Then call converse again when the wait is over:

```python
voicemode:converse("Five minutes is up. Ready when you are.")
```

**Configuration:** The short pause duration is configurable via `VOICEMODE_WAIT_DURATION` (default: 60 seconds).

## STT Recovery - Manual Transcription

If Whisper STT fails but the audio was recorded successfully, you can manually transcribe the saved audio file:

```bash
# Transcribe the most recent recording
whisper-cli ~/.voicemode/audio/latest-STT.wav

# Or check if file exists first (safe for inclusion in automation)
if [ -f ~/.voicemode/audio/latest-STT.wav ]; then
  whisper-cli ~/.voicemode/audio/latest-STT.wav
fi
```

**Requirements:**

- Audio saving must be enabled via one of:
  - `VOICEMODE_SAVE_AUDIO=true` in `~/.voicemode/voicemode.env`
  - `VOICEMODE_SAVE_ALL=true` (saves all audio and transcriptions)
  - `VOICEMODE_DEBUG=true` (enables debug mode with audio saving)

**How it works:**

- VoiceMode saves all STT recordings to `~/.voicemode/audio/` with timestamps
- The `latest-STT.wav` symlink always points to the most recent recording
- If the STT API fails, the recording is still saved for manual recovery
- This lets you recover the user's speech without asking them to repeat

**When to use:**

- STT service timeout or connection failure
- Transcription returned empty but user definitely spoke
- Need to verify what was actually said vs. what was transcribed

## Voice Handoff Between Agents

Transfer voice conversations between Claude Code agents for multi-agent workflows.

**Use cases:**

- Personal assistant routing to project-specific foremen
- Foremen delegating to workers for focused tasks
- Returning control when work is complete

### Quick Reference

```python
# 1. Announce the transfer
voicemode:converse("Transferring you to a project agent.", wait_for_response=False)

# 2. Spawn with voice instructions (mechanism depends on your setup)
spawn_agent(path="/path", prompt="Load voicemode skill, use converse to greet user")

# 3. Go quiet - let new agent take over
```

**Hand-back:**

```python
voicemode:converse("Transferring you back to the assistant.", wait_for_response=False)
# Stop conversing, exit or go idle
```

### Key Principles

1. **Announce transfers**: Always tell the user before transferring
2. **One speaker**: Only one agent should use converse at a time
3. **Distinct voices**: Different voices make handoffs audible
4. **Provide context**: Tell receiving agent why user is being transferred

### Auto-focus tmux pane on speak (opt-in)

When you run multiple voice agents in separate tmux panes, set
`VOICEMODE_AUTO_FOCUS_PANE=true` to make tmux follow the speaker. Focus
switches **after conch acquisition**, so agents waiting on the conch never
steal focus -- only the agent about to speak does. It also respects the
`~/.voicemode/focus-hold` sentinel written by the show-me plugin, so a
file you just opened stays on screen for its hold window.

```bash
# ~/.voicemode/voicemode.env
VOICEMODE_AUTO_FOCUS_PANE=true
```

Off by default. Silent no-op outside tmux.

## Sharing Voice Services Over Tailscale

Expose local Whisper (STT) and Kokoro (TTS) to other devices on your Tailnet via HTTPS.

### Why

- Browsers require HTTPS for microphone access (e.g., VoiceMode Connect web app)
- Tailscale serve provides automatic HTTPS with valid Let's Encrypt certificates for `*.ts.net` domains
- Enables using your powerful local machine's GPU from any device on your Tailnet

### Setup

```bash
# Expose TTS (Kokoro on port 8880)
tailscale serve --bg --set-path /v1/audio/speech http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech

# Expose STT (Whisper on port 2022)
tailscale serve --bg --set-path /v1/audio/transcriptions http://localhost:2022/v1/audio/transcriptions

# Verify configuration
tailscale serve status

# Reset all serve config
tailscale serve reset
```

### Endpoints

After setup, endpoints are available at:

- **TTS:** `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/v1/audio/speech`
- **STT:** `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net/v1/audio/transcriptions`

### Important Notes

- **Path mapping**: Tailscale strips the incoming path before forwarding, so you MUST include the full path in the target URL
- **Same-machine testing**: Traffic doesn't route through Tailscale locally — test from another Tailnet device
- **Multiple paths**: You can configure different paths to different backends on the same or different machines
- **CORS**: Kokoro has CORS configured to allow `https://app.voicemode.dev` origins

### Use with VoiceMode Connect

In the VoiceMode Connect web app settings (app.voicemode.dev/settings), set:

- **TTS Endpoint**: `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net`
- **STT Endpoint**: `https://<hostname>.<tailnet>.ts.net`

## Soundfonts

Audio feedback tones that play during Claude Code tool use. Toggle with `voicemode soundfonts on/off`. See [Soundfonts Guide](../../docs/guides/soundfonts.md).

## Remote Voice with VoiceMode Connect

When local voice isn't an option -- no mic/speaker on the machine, can't install local services, or want to use a phone -- **VoiceMode Connect** provides remote voice through a web app or mobile device.

**When to suggest Connect:**
- User can't install Whisper/Kokoro locally (unsupported platform, permissions, corporate machine)
- User wants to talk to their agent from a phone or tablet
- User is on a remote/headless machine without audio hardware
- Local voice services are failing and quick troubleshooting hasn't helped

**How it works:** Add the VoiceMode MCP server to any Claude product, open app.voicemode.dev on a phone or browser, and talk. No local TTS/STT installation needed -- the client device handles audio.

**Setup:** See the [VoiceMode Connect skill](../voicemode-connect/SKILL.md) for MCP configuration and getting started.
